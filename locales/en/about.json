Unfortunately, that also lead to a few years of bullying. I later switched schools and got surrounded by friendlier classmates. Right around that time, my love for computer games was also gaining traction.",

During the summer of 2016, I got madly in love with cycling and travelled over 2000km in just two months. I still vividly remember the good vibes all the cycling brought me.",
				"1": "Towards the end of high school, I realized that I would actually prefer to study abroad rather than in my home country, which is why, towards the end of 2016, I started taking English seriously and started learning it on my own. About a year later, I passed the CAE certificate, and the day when I got the results has been the best day of my life. A few months after that, I managed to pass my high school finals and get offered a study place in Aalborg, Denmark."

As soon as I had gone through a few sections of HTML tutorials, I was hooked and began my journey towards becoming a web developer.",

I also began volunteering behind the bar at Studenterhuset, and it was a mesmerizing experience through the few months of my being there. Moving to Copenhagen was a very good decision, mostly for the opportunities that the city presents. I’ve met many new people, some of which have stayed my friends, and it’s a beautiful city with tons to offer."

There’s many different options that I can choose - moving to another country, taking some time off to travel, dedicating more time to pursuing my hobbies, and so on. I definitely have a few ideas worth spending time on in mind, but only time will tell which of them will come to fruition. If I should be more specific, however, I would say that I’m going to explore the world of web development further, a lot further, and perhaps transition into another branch of programming such as artificial intelligence.",

I’ve spent so many years in Denmark and the country has simply become so ingrained in me at this point, that I would like to learn the language to the fullest. It won’t be an easy task by any means, but as many others have proved, it can be done."
