I wasn't sure where to go. All I knew was that I'd like to see something that doesn't
break my budget. Having a few places in mind, browsing Skyscanner and trying to figure
out where to go, I pointed at Belgium.

# Planning

The very first thing I absolutely wanted to try that I've never done before was to
fit everything into a single 20L backpack. Is that even possible for 3 days? Well, we
will definitely find out. Next thing I absolutely wanted to try that I've never done
before was hostel accommodation. Up until the age 24, I've only done Airbnbs. Like...
can you even take a breather, or is it just a bunch of people in one room? I guess we
will find out about that, too.

Alright, cool, I booked my flight and accommodation. Packing list time. I had to
remember to only pack the essentials since I was travelling light and mobile. Alright,
4 T-shirts it is. And if I won't use all of them, so be it. Better safe than sorry.
The rest of the list was pretty straightforward and thankfully I didn't forget anything.

# Day 1 - arrival and tour de Bruxelles

After many grueling attempts, I managed to open my eyes at 4:15 AM. Everything was ready
to go. Getting to the airport was the easy part - but the realization that I was on trip
by myself without any friends or family was a bit overwhelming. I knew it was entirely
up to me to make it count, meet fellow travellers and hopefully do some exciting stuff
together. Or at least that's what I was hoping for - because I was definitely not planning
on spending my precious time in Belgium in solitude.

I landed at Brussels Airport around 3 hours later. It was time to start figuring things
out, as usual - how to get to all the places, where's the currency exchange, where's
the train station, etc. One rule of thumb is this: if you're not sure where to go, just
follow the crowd. All crowds lead to Rome. Or... do they?

The arrival to the city center got me in a state of bliss - the city was beautiful, and
I almost felt like I was in a more beautiful Paris. The amount of French written and
spoken around every corner only added to the feeling. It felt somewhat familiar, even
though I've never been to Paris. All the small and cozy cafés, the beautiful architecture,
the locals, the vibe - it was all there.

It was about time for some sightseeing. Visiting the EU Parliament is free of charge, and
I definitely recommend it. The entire district is very modern, clean and full of
enthusiastic people. Next stop was the Grand Place - the main square of Brussels. I can
almost guarantee that you've never seen more Gothic architecture in one place. This was
also the place where I met my first fellow traveller who brought others along, and we had
agreed to take a walking tour together.

Our hilarious, talkative and energetic tour guide took us on a 3-hour tour adventure through
the city. From now on, remember that the best waffle is the one with only chocolate - all
the creamy ones only get mushy! I'm glad I had that exact one. After the tour was over, we
decided to grab some food, head back to our hostel, have drinks, chat, play pool and just
have a good time. It was a great way to end the day.

# Day 2 - picturesque Bruges

It wouldn't be a trip to Belgium without visiting Bruges. Victoriously leaving the hostel
where I survived my first night without any problems, I headed to the Bruxelles-Zuid
station. I got to witness how the platform was transformed from a quiet, empty place to a
bustling crowd of people in a matter of minutes. I was on my way to Bruges.

The Belgian countryside looks almost identical to the one in France. In fact, I probably
wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The train ride was a bit uncomfortable due to
the overwhelming amount of people who got the same idea as me - to go to Bruges on a
beautiful Saturday morning - but all that was forgotten once I arrived in the city.

Despite the crowds of tourists, I was taken away immediately. The streets, the people,
the small boutiques and cafés, the architecture, the chocolate shops - it all adds to
a very unique atmosphere. Bruges is a city that looks like it's straight out of a fairy
tale. It's no wonder that it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. Some
people also call it the Venice of the North, and I can definitely see why - some houses
are almost floating on the water!

I took it to the chocolate shops later that day. If there was a thing as a chocolate
capital of Europe, it would definitely be Bruges. I've never seen so many different
kinds of chocolate in one place - and it wasn't even so expensive! I can imagine that
the shops are even more crowded during the Christmas season, but on the flip side,
it must look even nicer.

I had a great time visiting Bruges. The city is incredibly charming, has a very unique
vibe, and is definitely worth a visit. I would recommend to visit Bruges on a weekend
during Christmas, as I can imagine that it would be even more beautiful than it already
is. It definitely has a lot to offer and its architecture is something that you probably
won't see anywhere else. I would definitely go back there again.

# Day 3 - Brussels and departure

I had reached out to another fellow traveller who was also staying at the same hostel,
and we decided to take it to the Atomium. It's a 102-meter-high structure made of 9
spheres that are connected by tubes. At first glance, it looks a lot bigger than in the
pictures. You might get particularly impressed by the lighting effects that are used
in the tubes - it's hypnotizing to watch, and nothing for epileptics.

The view from the top is quite nice, too. You can see a lot of Brussels from there. I
would recommend to bundle it with a visit to the Mini-Europe park, which is located
right next to it. It's a miniature park that features 350 models of European landmarks
and monuments. Just keep in mind that the bundle ticket is 30 EUR for an adult, which
isn't exactly cheap. If you catch good weather, however, it's definitely worth spending
the few hours and the ticket price to see both of them.

The Parc du Cinquantenaire is also a great place to visit. Its main attraction is perhaps
the Triumphal Arch, which is a 50-meter-high arch that was built to commemorate the
founding of the Belgian state. The arch gives off a very noble and majestic vibe. I took
a walk around the park, bought some original Belgian chocolate and headed back to the
airport.

# Conclusion

I think Belgium is a bit underrated. Sure, it's not the most popular destination in
Europe nor it is Paris or Amsterdam, but there's definitely something unique about it
that makes it stand out. Perhaps it's the combination of the Gothic architecture, the
extraordinary amount of chocolate shops, the beer, the French vibe and the beautiful
countryside. Bruges is a city that absolutely cannot be dismissed, so if your only
city of interest is Brussels, I highly recommend to take a day trip to Bruges. It's
definitely worth it and you won't regret it.

What I remember from Belgium the most is how the time slowed down. Being surrounded by
so many coffee shops and cafés in the center makes time seem to stand still. As if the
city itself is telling you to take it easy and enjoy the moment. I think that's a lesson
that we all need to learn from time to time. I'm glad I got to experience it first-hand.
