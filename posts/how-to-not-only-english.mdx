The last few months have got me thinking quite a lot about how I would learn a new language
from scratch if I had to. It's a question with a lot of ambiguity and specificity at the
same time, because I've been partially able to follow through on my own advice by learning
Danish, and while there's still a ton of work ahead, I think I have a pretty good idea of
what I would do differently from what 'conventional wisdom' says if I had to start from scratch.

The following lines are not meant to be taken as a comprehensive guide to learning a new
language, but rather as a collection of thoughts and ideas that I've found useful in my own
journey, shaped by thousands upon thousands of hours of both active and passive learning. Some
of the ideas are not exactly things you'd like to hear or do, but I think they're worth
considering nonetheless, particularly given the value they can provide.

# Begin with the end in mind
I don't mind overemphasizing this point because it's the most fundamental one. A ship without
an end destination is a ship that will never reach the harbor. The same goes for learning a
language - if you don't know where you're headed, not only will it take you much longer to get
there, but you'll have a much more difficult time tracking your progress, not to mention the
increased likelihood of giving up along the way. I'm not saying you need to be crazy
specific, but having a relatively clear end destination in mind will do wonders for your
language learning journey.

Whether it's being able to talk to your friends in their native language, the ability to order
food in a restaurant or move to the country where the language is spoken and sign up for
a full academic course, the last thing you want to do here is shy away from being ambitious.
No matter how unattainable it may seem, **I highly encourage you not to settle for less**
just because you think it's more realistic.

<Highlight>
	**BAD** - "I want to be able to speak"
	<br />
	**GOOD** - "I want to be able to hold a basic conversation about anything with a native
	speaker without having to ask them to repeat themselves too often"
</Highlight>

# Know what to expect
Now that you've pinned it down, it's time to address the elephant in the room - your
process, practice and what you'll be doing will vary greatly depending on how far you'd like
to take the language. If you're just looking to be able to order food in a restaurant, you
can likely get away with basic grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary. On the flip side, if
your goal is to sound like a native and/or appear on live TV and have absolutely no accent,
you'll need to put in A LOT more work.

In the following sections, I'll try to briefly describe the steps I would take if I had to
learn a new language from scratch, and I'll be focusing more on learners who are looking to
reach a high level of proficiency - CEFR C1 and above. I'll also try to debunk common myths
and misconceptions about language learning, and lastly, try to give you some tips regardless
of your target level.

That being said, I think it's important to underscore the following:
<Highlight>
	The single biggest differentiator between where your language is today and where
	you would like it to be is the repeated daily practice of the language, no matter how
	insignificant it may seem in the moment. Practice adds up exponentially over time.
</Highlight>

# Beginner to intermediate
I won't bore you with a list of things you should be able to do at each level since that's
something you can easily find online.

When you're starting from scratch, the first thing you should be working on is the 'skeleton'
of the language - basic grammar, how sentences are constructed, etc. As much as I don't like
Duolingo, it's a good place to start, but don't expect it to teach you everything, especially
speaking. Once you're able to form basic sentences (e.g. "The gray cat is not playing"), start
practicing your 'output skills' - speaking and writing.

For intermediate learners, the goal would be to try to expand your vocabulary and express
yourself in a more colorful way. You should also be able to understand most of what you hear
around you, and be able to hold a basic conversation with a native speaker. Understanding all
grammar (for non-grammar-heavy languages) should be a given at this point. Try to slowly work
your way up to watching the news, listening to podcasts and reading books in the language.
You don't have to understand everything, but you should be able to understand the majority of
what you hear and read.

# Advanced to native-like
Reaching this level of proficiency requires a lot of work. Apart from things you can look up,
you'll need a near-native level for things like:

- participating in complex or political discussions
- reading books and watching movies without subtitles
- expressing slang and idioms correctly and effortlessly
- being in a highly academic or workplace environment
- flirting
<br />
Apart from the steps outlined in the previous section, you can also consider:
- intensive listening - listening to a short (15-30s) segment where your aim is to understand
every single word that is being said
- reading out loud - this will do wonders for your pronunciation and speaking skills
- reading books - books are the holy grail of reading skills
- pronunciation drills - find a native speaker pronouncing a word you're struggling with and
record yourself saying it. Listen to the recording and try to imitate the native speaker. Repeat
until you're satisfied with your pronunciation. It took me 2 months to nail down the
pronunciation of the word 'comfortable', so don't be discouraged if it takes you a while.

For reading, perhaps the biggest obstacle will be overcoming the 'sufficiently advanced' plateau
where you're quite comfortable reading and understanding the language, but you still don't
understand more than 98% of what you read. This is a very common phenomenon, and it's
something you'll have to work through. I'd say the best way to overcome this plateau is to read
books that are slightly above your level, but not too much, and then gradually increase the
difficulty level as you get more comfortable. Reading this material will also help you
tremendously with writing, although a lot of output is non-negotiable.

When it comes to speaking, your best bet would be to reach out to a native speaker who can help
you with your pronunciation and accent. There are many platforms on the web where you can find
native speakers who are willing to help you out. If you can't find anyone, no matter how
ridiculous this may sound, you can always talk to yourself. I know it sounds weird, but it's
actually a very effective way of practicing your speaking skills. I've done it myself and it
worked wonders for the coherence of my speech. For pronunciation and accent, I can only
recommend reading out loud - taking a short paragraph from a book or article and reading it
out loud. This requires, however, that you know exactly how to pronounce each word you're
reading, which is why this technique requires sufficient listening skills. When implemented
correctly, however, it's a very effective way of improving your pronunciation and accent.

You may also notice that reading out loud will get you tired very quickly in the beginning.
This is perfectly normal, and in my case, I could only manage 20 minutes of doing it at first.
Almost a year later, however, I could do it for 3 hours straght.

# Let's debunk some myths
... because there are a few!

## You need to move to the country where the language is spoken
In today's world of the internet, you can learn a language from anywhere. All you really need
is a stable internet connection, good resources and the will to learn. There are many learners
just like you who are looking to improve their language skills with a native. One resource is
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/language_exchange/).

## You need to attend classes
I dislike classes for two main reasons - they tend to be expensive and they create the notion
that you have to passively wait to be taught things rather than proactively seek them out on
your own. I'm not saying that classes are bad - they definitely work for a large pool of
people, but I think they're overrated. Don't think you absolutely HAVE TO attend classes
to learn a language - you simply don't.

## You need grammar/vocabulary drills
Let me tell you a little secret - I have **NEVER** picked up a grammar book for learning
English, and I'd say my grammar is decent-at-worst. Grammar and vocabulary drills are
infamously boring and disliked by most people, and for a good reason. The good news is,
you can skip them altogether and learn from articles, blog posts, books, etc. Your brain
is a pattern recognition machine, and it will pick up the patterns and meaning on its
own, you just have to give it some context.

## English is easy, Japanese is hard
Depends who you ask, actually. For a Chinese person, learning Japanese is probably much
easier than learning English since the two languages have developed in a completely
different time and space, and in many aspects, Japanese is closer to Chinese than English.
For a native English speaker, Spanish will be easier. You can hopefully see how saying that
one language is more difficult than another is a bit of a stretch.

What does apply, however, is that every language has its quirks and nuances and things that
are very specific for learning that particular language. For example, English has a lot of
phrases, Danish will kill you with pronunciation, and Czech will fry your brain with how
complex its grammar is.

# Random tips here and there

## Focus on the process, not the goal
You'll only be disappointed if you keep looking at how much there's still left to learn. A much
better approach would be to take one step at a time, and then look back after a few months and
see how much you've grown in the meantime.

## Celebrate the small victories
No matter your goal, it will take you a while. Praising yourself and celebrating your progress
can go a long way - as soon as you notice progress at something, that's already a reason to
celebrate! I remember listening to a live NBC broadcast during the 2020 presidential election
in the US, and crying because I could understand everything word by word. That's something I
would have never thought of doing just 4 years prior, so I made sure to drop some tears of joy.

## Don't take tests and scores too seriously
Make sure you're learning the language for its practical usability, not for a random number
on a paper you can show off. A language is first and foremost a communication tool, not a thing
to be meticulously studied or measured on a scale. Just because you scored 190 points on a test
and your friend got 192 points doesn't mean he's more skilled. Focus on the practical usability
of the language instead of scores, numbers and levels and you'll be just fine.

## Imitate, imitate, imitate
If there's only one advice I would give people, it's the above. Try to imitate native speakers
as much as possible, and in all aspects - grammar, spelling, vocabulary, pronunciation...
they're the best teachers, after all, even if they don't know what they're doing.
