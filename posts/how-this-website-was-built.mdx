<Highlight>
	First of all, welcome to my **brand new blog!** ðŸŽ‰
	I'm really excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts and ideas with the world.
</Highlight>

<br />
As the very first post,
I thought it would be nice to give you a little insight into how this website was built.

# The problem(s)

The last time I built my own website was in early 2020. A lot has changed since then.
New frameworks have been released, existing frameworks have been enhanced with new features,
and many libraries have died - the ever changing world of web development.

Apart from the aging problem, there was another one on the horizon - my previous website
didn't really look all that good. I wanted something that was more modern, more minimalistic,
and less boring. And one day while scrolling through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/),
I had a winner.

# Mantine UI to the rescue!

The [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) library is a React UI library that provides
a lot of components that are easy to use and look great out of the box. I was beyond
happy to finally have found a great replacement for Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI
and all the other libraries that I had tried in the past. It felt like a breath of
fresh air.

Discovering Mantine gave me the kick I needed to get cracking. But since building a
website from scratch is a lot of work, I decided to write down all the necessary steps
first, and tackle them one at a time.

# The steps themselves

In general, the steps I took to build this website looked something like:

1. Figure out the purpose, features, and requirements of the website
2. Come up with content (paragraphs, images etc.) that will serve that purpose
3. Build a site map (a diagram that shows the structure of the website)
4. Design the website (layout etc.)
5. Build the skeleton and simple components first
6. Add the content, localized for different languages
7. Polish the look with transitions, optimize performance, and add SEO
8. Build the whole blog system
9. Set up analytics

## Purpose, features and requirements
During this stage, you would usually ask yourself what do you want the visitor of your
website to take away. In my case, I wanted the visitor to have a convenient way of
reaching out to me, show my work experience, my skills, hobbies, passions, and some
volunteering experience. I also wanted to have a blog where I could write cool posts
like this one.

In terms of design and tech, I wanted the website to be clean, minimalistic, responsive,
reasonably fast and easy to navigate. Lastly, I wanted the website to be localized in all
the languages I speak in order to accommodate for the different audiences.

## Content
This was the trickiest part - writing down all headings, paragraphs, images, sections...
Coming up with content that isn't monotone and doesn't shift too much when changing
languages is by no means easy. A few weeks later, though, I had a good amount of content
that I was happy with.

## Site map
This is a diagram that shows the structure of the website. It's a great way to visualize
the content and make sure that it's all there. I actually skipped this part organized
the content into sections and pages in Notion instead.

## Design
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design the website. I think I've learned more
about Figma in the few short days of designing with it than all the previous years combined.

Here's a little sneak peek of the design:

## Skeleton
This meant building a few atomic components of UI that will be used for the majority of the
content displayed. Things like text, images, whitespace, buttons, what font sizes should be
used, what colors, font faces, thicknesses of the font, etc.

## Localized content
This was actually quite tedious. I had to write down all the content in English first,
and then translate it into the other languages. I used [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/)
to translate the content, and then went through it manually to make sure it's all correct.

## Polish
This is where I added transitions, animations, and other small details that make the website
feel more alive. I also optimized the performance of the website, and added SEO. Here are
some of the results:

## Blog system
This was one of the most time-consuming parts. I had to build a blog system that would allow
me to write posts in MDX files, and then display them on the website. I might want to enhance
the blog system in the future as well.

## Analytics
This is the last item on the list, and I'm still not quite sure which tool I'd like to use
here. Let's also keep in mind GDPR and other privacy laws that might come into play.

# Conclusion
I'm very happy with the result. The new website looks MUCH cleaner, fresher, and more modern.
Finally more like a 2022 website. I'm also very happy with the blog system that I built. It's
very easy to write posts, and even have tags for different topics. If there are any other
features that you'd like to see, please let me know! I have some in mind, but my strategy here
is 'underpromise and overdeliver', so I'll keep them to myself for now ðŸ˜„
