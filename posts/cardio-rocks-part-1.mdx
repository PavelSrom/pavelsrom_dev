Running is one of the most popular sports in the world, and one of the most accesible - all
you really need is a pair of decent shoes and half an hour or more of time. Even though
I've been mostly doing strength training since 2016, I realized a few months ago that I
don't want to be either of the two extremes - neither a ripped bodybuilder who can't run
a mile, nor a skinny guy who can't do 10 pullups. I want to be able to do both, and
hopefully be able to do them somewhat well.

# First, a bit of history
I've been practicing various different kinds of sports throughout my life. I played tennis
for a few years as my first competitive sport, I played football, table tennis, even
basketball at times. In 2013, I moved away from doing competitive sports and started
doing calisthenics and bodyweight training. I've been doing that ever since, with the
occasional inclusion of cycling as my cardio supplement - and it's that combination of
both strength training and cardio that is, in my opinion, very powerful and effective.

During the two months of calisthenics and cycling I did in the summer of 2016, I managed
to end the summer break with about 2000km total distance cycled. It might have even been
the best shape of my life at that point when it comes to endurance. Not only was I very
fit and strong, but cycling after 30 minutes almost felt like a meditative state. It was
very relaxing, almost zen-like - to be able to turn your brain off for 3 hours, forget
about everything and just perceive the music in your earphones, the road, and the beautiful
landscape around. I've been missing that zen-like feeling for a long time.

# Pavel started running, but wrong

## The incident
After my fiasco in the mountains of Montenegro in the summer of 2022, it dawned on me that
perhaps it's time for me to do something about my cardio a little bit. It wasn't a fiasco
per se, but climbing up the first hike at above 2000m altitude turned out to be a painstaking
struggle. I had to stop and rest a few times, and for sure I had expected more from myself.

And so, I started running. Bringing that 'no pain no gain' mentality from the gym, I thought
the way to improve my cardio is by what I've always done - by pedal to the metal and pushing
myself to the max. I ran 3km at a quite speedy pace, but my heart rate towards the end was
above 200 BPM - and in the upper 180s as average. Needless to say I was exhausted afterwards
and had to take a few days off from running.

## ...but it kept getting worse
Unfortunately enough, I kept that mentality for a few more months, despising running and
hating every second of it. I would wake up, put on my shoes, get destroyed on a 5K, come
back, take a shower, and take a nap (!) for at least 20 minutes, simply because I was just
too tired to do anything else. Not to mention the fact that I was getting shin splints and
other injuries from running on hard surfaces, and I couldn't run consistently.

Weeks went by and I saw little to no improvement. I was stuck in a cycle of hopeless
perpetuity. "This can't be right", I thought. Turned out I was doing it all wrong. You don't
build your cardio by running as fast as you can all the time, you build it by running at an
easy pace for the vast majority of your training.

# The right way to run - at least for me
In mid December last year, I discovered the Maffetone Method. Its fundamental premise
is that you should run slower to run faster. Sounds counterintuitive, but from my experience
so far, it's true. By running at a pace where your heart rate is somewhere below or up to
180 BPM minus your age, you're training your body not only to use fat as primary fuel source,
but also to use oxygen more efficiently - which is the key to running faster. Your heart
will be able to pump more blood per stroke, and your muscles will be able to use more oxygen
to produce energy.

## I had to SLOOOOOOW down
From then on, I stopped looking at the pace and instead, I focused on my heart rate. My goal
was to keep it below 160 BPM and below 155 BPM as average. It was frustrating at first - I
was incredibly slow and, in order to maintain my heart rate, I had to transition into walking
sometimes. My initial pace was somewhere around 7:55/km which was a huge step down from my
previous 5:40/km pace - but I was determined to stick with it.

## 2 months in - where things stand
After about 2 months of running roughly 3 times per week, I've managed to improve my pace by
more than a minute per kilometer! That's a huge improvement over the course of just 2 months.
I'm now running at about 6:50/km or even faster sometimes. It's incredibly satistying to see
my heart rate stay the same or slightly drop even though I'm running faster. Running itself
feels so much more enjoyable, I come home and feel like I could run that again. Thanks to
slowing down, I recover much faster and I'm able to run more often.

Almost all my runs are easy runs. I run tempo here and there, but rather occasionally. Below
are some stats from my Apple Watch:

# How I will continue
I'm going to continue running around 3 times per week, and keep the focus on my heart rate.
Once I get to a 5K pace of 6:00/km, I'll start doing some speedwork. In terms of the bigger
picture, I would like to be able to run the Copenhagen Half Marathon in under 2 hours.
There's only 7 months left until D-day, so I got plenty of work and conditioning to do!

My medium-term to-do list:
- Weekly long runs of 90-120 minutes
- Tempo 5K or other speedwork once every other week
- Keep up the schedule of 3 runs per week
- Increase cadence to 160-170 steps per minute
- Maintain 85%+ of runs at easy pace

Let's see how it goes! I'm no crystal ball, but I think it's feasible, despite my heavier
weight of 85kg. I'll write an update before the summer break to see how I've progressed.
