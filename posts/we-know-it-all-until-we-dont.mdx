It dawned on me recently that it has been almost 5 years since I embarked on my web
development journey. Anyone who has consistently worked with anything over a stretch
of many years will be familiar with the overwhelming transition from 5 years ago to
today. In other words, a lot can happen in 5 years. Like... really, a LOT.

In high school, I studied IT, among other things. I remember vividly how excited I could
get, 'knowing' that I would never touch programming languages again in my life. They just
didn't click for me - C# was too complicated, PHP's syntax was a mess, and when I saw the
results of even markup languages like HTML and CSS, I couldn't imagine them being even
remotely useful for anything other than building a brutalist website to impress your
grandmother. They were anything but for me.

# How it all started

I moved to Denmark in August 2018 with the goal of learning to edit videos, some basic
filmmaking, cinematography, animations and such. I had been fiddling a bit with Camtasia
at home for a few years, but it never really materialized into anything significant, which
is why I wanted to go deeper at university.

I will likely never forget day 3 of school - the first day of actually diving into something,
rather than just setting up email inboxes and internal systems. To my surprise, the topic of
choice was HTML - and I was left disappointed. "Why this thing again?", I asked myself,
trying to handle the internal struggle of doing something I dearly disliked. It almost sounds
comical today, in the context of what followed, but I just didn't know any better.

When I came home that day, I started working on the homework we had been given during the
lectures. The assignment was to put a few headings and paragraphs into the document. We were
simply instructed to briefly introduce ourselves. It was on that day that I discovered
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Being able to code on the left and immediately
see the result on the right was surprisingly mesmerizing. Suddenly, all the hatred I had
towards HTML dissolved. It almost never happened, and the rest is history.

# A very sobering experience

A little over a year later, I felt perhaps the most confident I've ever been. Any challenge
thrown at me at school felt like a walk in the park. I was consistently surpassing my peers
in coding, sweeping through assignments like it was nothing. If this sounds like a boastful
claim from a young man in his early 20s about to face reality, that's because it's supposed
to - I was squarely at the 'Peak of Mount Stupid' of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

In January 2020, I started my first internship at a small startup called Senti. As expected,
I had very little responsibilities, mostly just cosmetic improvements of the source code and
adding new small features to the product. Coming from a background of small coding tasks and
school assignments, I was aware things are going to be more difficult, but what I never saw
coming was the immense learning curve of coming to a new, much larger software project.
Needless to reiterate I had barely any responsibilities.

A few weeks in, I was reaching new bottoms of my desperation tank. I had entered phase 2 of
the Dunning-Kruger effect - the 'Valley of Despair'. I felt completely incompetent, stupid,
and as if everyone else is better than me. That's a very healthy (and necessary!) reaction
to being exposed to a problem requiring much more competence and experience.

# The Developer Starter Pack

The cool thing about being a programmer is that the necessary healthy skepticism towards
your abilities never goes away. The programming world is a bottomless ocean of many
different languages, frameworks, libraries and tools. There's simply so much that it's
impossible to know everything. No wonder why programmers mutually respect each other, and
why only a programmer can appreciate the skill and expertise of another programmer.

Having now clocked in over 1,5 years of full-time work experience, I can confidently say
that my expectations before entering the industry were very different from what my day looks
like today. I'm pretty sure writing down all the lessons learned would qualify for a
standalone blog post, but let's briefly look at a few:

- I used to think open offices were detrimental for programmers due to constant interruptions
that can occur. Now it's my preferred way of working unless people are VERY loud. After all,
noise-cancelling headphones are nothing new.
- It's important to write things down all the time. Don't rely on "I'll remember it" - you
won't. Furthermore, nobody is interested in having to explain the same thing 420 times.
- There are quiet days and then there are days where you get pulled in so many different
directions. Context switching is real, and it sucks. Your brain works like RAM.
- There are always loopholes and neglected areas. No one company has it all figured out,
because there's no perfect process.
- Work-life balance is important. Make it a habit that the moment you leave the office, you
don't think about work until 9am the next day.

# If I could do it all over...

It's actually quite simple - embrace the beginner mentality and never grow your ego above its
appropriate size would be my best advice. Schools and universities will only teach you enough
to get your foot in the door, they won't make you an expert. I know it's probably a cliche
thing to say, but perhaps the only way to let it really sink in is to have been there yourself.

We all think we're experts until we meet someone who REALLY knows their s..t. When you talk
to such person, you won't understand half of what they're saying, and that's the better case
scenario. There's always more to learn and master - languages evolve, new tools come out
almost every day (I'm looking at you, JavaScript frameworks!). I'm glad to have experienced
the programming world, because it encourages genuine respectfulness and solidarity, something
we could always enjoy more of in the whole world.
