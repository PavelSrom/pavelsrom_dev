It happened seemingly out of nowhere. In the span of just a few short weeks, we've
experienced a massive leap forward in the field of artificial intelligence. OpenAI has
released GPT-4, Google is now adding their PaLM model to the Workspace suite, Microsoft is
integrating their GPT-powered Copilot into basically everything, Midjourney v5 has been
released and it's capable of generating images indistinguishable from real, captured ones,
and the list goes on. Above all that, however, is the release of ChatGPT, a large language
model that has gained [100 million users in less than 2 months](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/),
beating even TikTok by 7 months! Where is this all going? Let me try to paint my predictions.

# Short-term: a massive disruption is coming

We can already see the effects of these AI tools in the wild. ChatGPT is the new hot topic
among journalists, teachers, students, programmers and many others. I even use it to help me
write these blog posts! It can generate academic essays, proofread homework, write emails
in a plethora of different styles, generate advanced code snippets in all popular languages,
and even present possible recipes based on your picture of the ingredients you have in the
fridge. If that doesn't amaze you already, just give it a few more years.

It's no secret that ChatGPT and similar tools are already being used by millions of people and
quickly becoming mainstream. It reminds me of the early days of social media, when Facebook
was just a small college network. A few years later, it became the most popular social media
platform in the world. Thanks to the ubiquity of technology, the adoption of AI and their
integration into our daily lives will be even faster.

It's difficult to predict exactly how this will play out. Inevitably, people will lose jobs,
universities will have to rethink their curricula, knowledge workers' productivity will
skyrocket, many things will become easier or automated, new paradigms will emerge.

# Medium-term: breakthroughs in many industries

This is the part that gets me excited the most. ChatGPT is just the tip of the iceberg. Give
the AI development a decade or two and you'll be astounded. Imagine a person with an IQ of
the average Stanford PhD student, but with excellent expertise in every field of knowledge.
That's when we'll see the real breakthroughs - when AI becomes capable of generating new,
previously undiscovered knowledge.

Continuous cell repair to slow down aging, a cure for all forms of cancer, mainsteam adoption
of fusion energy, much more effective manufacturing processes, possibly even reversing the
effects of global warming... these are just a few of the things that could be achieved in
the next few decades, and I believe are very likely to be achieved by 2050 or at least in
our lifetimes.

If you find it hard to believe that AI could be capable of such things, keep in mind that
human progress has always been exponential, not linear. If you lived in the 1700s, you
probably wouldn't notice many changes in the world around you from the previous century.
If you lived in 1919 where planes were just becoming somewhat capable of flying, would you
believe that in just 50 years, we'd have people on the moon? Would you believe that in 100
years, we would live in a perfectly globalized world where a large portion of the population
has access to an abundance of food, drinking water, medical care, education, information and
entertainment? That we would be able to communicate with anyone in the world in real time,
from anywhere in the world? And that, dear reader, is the power of exponential progress. That
is the world we live in today.


# Long-term: singularity? (or not)

As I outlined in the previous section, I believe the true breakthrough will happen at a point
where AI becomes capable of generating new knowledge. It's almost impossible to tell what
happens after that, but it seems increasingly likely that we need to invent AGI in order for
humanity to become interstellar.

Now it's time to think truly big - what if AI could create materials stronger than diamonds,
lighter than air, manipulate individual atoms to create virtually any material, or even
outsource our brain and soul to a computer? What if we could build the [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere)
and harness all the energy of the Sun? How about time travel, teleportation or immortality?

It it absolutely wild to think about these things, but if you think about it, we're already
living in a world that would have been considered science fiction just a few decades ago.
I guess the only way to find out if I was right about my medium-term predictions set to
happen by 2050 is to wait until 2050 and look back :)
