It didn't take me very long into my career to realize that writing software is hard, and that
trying to do so at scale is even harder. What exactly "scale" means can vary for different
people and across different contexts. For me, it's a combination of the subjective complexity
of a system, the number of people working on it, and the number of users it serves.

I've worked on or even co-designed systems that were meant to be used by a handful of
developers and serve a few thousand users, but trying to build the very same system to be
used by dozens of developers and serve a clientelle of hundreds of thousands or even millions
of end users is a very different undertaking. This is the kind of scale I'm talking about,
and my first attempt at building something that can handle such scale.

At my job, we've been trying to solve the issue of data fetching and server state management
across the different parts of our apps for a while. We've tried different approaches and
while most of them have worked reasonably well, none of them were "The One". That being said,
I think I might have found "The One", and while it's still in its early stages, I'm hopeful,
so take it chronologically.

# The problem

There are a few major things we've been struggling with:

- we don't really have a unified, consistent way of fetching and managing server data - it's
mostly a mixture of different libraries and patterns used across different places in the app
- we're dealing with lots of repetitive, boilerplate code, causing friction and productivity
decline, all while reinventing the wheel and making the codebase harder to maintain
- we don't have a reliable way to handle polling based on response headers our backend APIs
send us back
- we don't have a way to set global settings for a given API service (set of requests,
usually with the same base URL) in a single place - e.g. default error handling of 404
responses or disabling retries service-wide

## Thunks, SWR, and the like

Some parts of our apps dispatch thunk actions, then fetch data inside of them, then dispatch
the responses to the store along with "secondary" actions (e.g. setting loading state), then
let the components subscribe to the store and render the data. Sounds like a mouthful and a
lot of work, doesn't it? Well, now you know why my aversion for doing async stuff	in Redux
grew so much over the years. To eat a soup with a fork is simply not a good idea.

Other parts of our apps use SWR, and while I conceptually really root for SWR, I find it
lacking in features. It's lightweight and enjoyable for simple use cases, but once the
complexity goes up, SWR just doesn't cut it.

**Before I continue any further, I really want to emphasize that the problems I've just listed
are not unique to our software nor something that cannot be solved. For the most part, our
systems are doing what they're supposed to do, and they're doing it somewhat well, but I
believe we would be selling ourselves short if we didn't aspire to do better.**

## Failed attempts

We tried to come up with a Tanstack-Query-based proof of concept many months ago, but it
didn't really go anywhere as it was lacking in features and a bit difficult to maintain and
extend. Polling was missing altogether, and since some parts of our apps rely on it heavily
to keep the data fresh and user experience smooth, no wonder we axed the PoC shortly
afterwards. I have, however, learned a few valuable lessons from the experience.

# The solution attempt

Since I've been using Tanstack Query in my previous jobs, personal projects and since its
inception with mere 40k weekly NPM downloads, I decided to spearhead the effort to build a
new, unified, scalable and feature-rich server state library for our apps. The choice of
Tanstack Query as the foundation was more or less a no-brainer - it's stood the test of time,
proving its worth and value in many different projects of various sizes and complexities, it
is still actively maintained (shoutout to Tanner Linsley and Dominik Dorfmeister), and it
seems to be the most feature-rich and flexible library of its kind. Cool, now we have a
foundation we can build upon, but what about the rest?

## Back to the drawing board

It was time to go back to the drawing board, endless meetings with our seniors and EMs,
requirement specifications and gathering feedback from the rest of the team. 15+ hours of
meetings later, we came up with the following list of major requirements:

- **environment-agnostic** - we need our API services to be able to work in the browser as
well as Node, both inside and outside React components, thus splitting responsibilities
between the different layers of abstraction
- **polling** - we need to be able to poll our API services based on response headers
- **consistency** - we need a unified, consistent way of fetching and managing server data,
ideally without much boilerplate
- **global settings** - we need a way to set global settings for a given API service in a
single place
- **per-request customization** - we need to be able to attach custom data to requests, e.g.
to pass a different token or base URL without affecting the rest of the API service
- **great developer experience** - the abstaction layer should "make sense" and guide the
developer in the right direction

## Me, myself and Notion

Whenever I design systems and abstractions, I like to start from the end and think about what
would be the most intuitive way to use it while still conforming to the necessary
requirements. Having requirements finally written down, I started to jot down some ideas and
possible syntaxes in Notion. If you've ever built an abstraction layer on top of a
lower-level API, you probably know how hard it is to strike a balance between these two. I
came up with a few ideas:

<Prism language="tsx">
{`
// 1. The "classic" way
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['postById', id],
  queryFn: () => fetch('/api/post/' + id)
  ...options
})

// 2. The "failed attempt" way
const { data, isLoading } = useTypedQuery('getPostById', {
  params: { id },
  ...options
})

// 3. The "I don't know what I'm doing" way
const { data, isLoading } = useTypedQuery({
  fetcher: 'getPostById',
  params: { id },
  ...options
})
`}
</Prism>
<br />

Options 2 and 3 aren't necessarily bad, but they feel very similar and there's just something
about them that doesn't feel right. Maybe it's the having to pass the fetcher name as a
string or having to specify the `params` object separately. Who knows...

Then one evening, while randomly reading through tRPC's documentation, it hit me:

<Prism language="tsx">
{`
const result = myService.whatRequest.whatCanHappenWithIt()
`}
</Prism>
<br />

Which would translate to:

<Prism language="tsx">
{`
const query = postsService.getPostById.useQuery({ id }, options)

queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: postsService.getPostById.getQueryKey({ id })
})
`}
</Prism>
<br />

This API felt so intuitive and natural that I couldn't believe I was about to conceptually
copy tRPC. A great benefit of this API is also the tight coupling between the query and its
query key, which makes it easy to invalidate the query when needed - all while preserving
the syntax and conceptual consistency `service.request.whatToDo()`.

Cool, so we're basically going to build a tRPC clone, but how exactly do we do that if tRPC
is a full-stack library and we only need the client part?

## Architecture & design decisions

### Why the `service.request.whatToDo()` syntax?

Most of all, it allows us to use a consistent API for not only executing queries and mutations,
but also when invalidating queries, manually setting query data, etc. Furthermore, it feels
intuitive, natural, and it just "makes sense".

### Why is `params` an object?

It allows for better type inference as we don't have to rely on the order of the arguments,
and it gives developers a better idea of what the query expects thanks to autocompletion and
type hints.
<br />

### Why is the underlying query key an object?

TkDodo wrote a great article on this topic, so I'm just going to redirect you [there](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/leveraging-the-query-function-context#object-query-keys).
<br />

### Why are some query options stripped away?

We don't want to expose all of the query options to the developer because some options are
manually set inside the abstraction layer and should not be changed - things like `queryKey`
and `queryFn` (which are managed by the abstraction itself), `context` (which is set
manually) and `meta` (which we don't use at all).
<br />

### Why Axios under the hood?

This isn't directly related to the API design, but it is related to our separation of concerns
and the environment-agnostic nature of our API services. Additionally, Axios's request config
is identical to the request options we expose to the developer, allowing for a seamless
customization and modification of base URLs, headers, etc.

## The final API

With all that being said, here's the final API I came up with, using an imaginary
`postsService` as an example. Notice the inspiration from tRPC:

<Prism language="tsx">
{`
// \`postsQueryApi\` is the hooks, \`postsUtils\` is the query client methods
const { postsQueryApi, postsUtils } = usePostsApi()

// 1. Fetching all posts
const allPostsQuery = postsQueryApi.getAllPosts.useQuery({})

// 2. Fetching a single post
const postByIdQuery = postsQueryApi.getPostById.useQuery({ id: 1 })

// 3. Fetching a single post with custom header and base URL attached
const postByIdQuery = postsQueryApi.getPostById.useQuery({ id: 1 }, {
  request: {
    baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer 123'
    }
  }
})

// 4. Creating a new post, invalidating the "all posts" query on success
const newPostMutation = postsQueryApi.createPost.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => {
    postsUtils.getAllPosts.invalidate()
  }
})

// 5. Manually setting the query data - equivalent to \`queryClient.setQueryData\`
postsUtils.getPostById.setData({ id: 1 }, { title: 'Hello, world!' })

// 6. Partial query matching support for query invalidation via a callback
postsUtils.getPostById.invalidate(() => ({ ...partialParams }))

// 7. Optimistic update for creating a new post
const newPostMutation = postsQueryApi.createPost.useMutation({
  onMutate: async (newPost) => {
    // cancel the ongoing query
    postsUtils.getAllPosts.cancel()
    // get the previous posts data
    const prevData = postsUtils.getAllPosts.getData()
    // update cache with the new post
    postsUtils.getAllPosts.setData((oldData) => {
      return [newPost, ...oldData]
    })
    // return the previous data to be used in case of an error
    return { prevData }
  },
  onError: (error, newPost, context) => {
    // if the mutation fails, revert the cache back to the previous state
    if (context?.prevData) {
      postsUtils.getAllPosts.setData(context.prevData)
    }
  },
  onSettled: () => {
    // re-fetch the query to get the latest data
    postsUtils.getAllPosts.invalidate()
  }
})
`}
</Prism>
<br />

The query results and mutation results are identical to what you'd get from using Tanstack
Query directly, but the syntax is much more intuitive and consistent, there's no need to
create custom hooks if you want to reuse the same query in different places, and you can
do everything you need using just one or two variables.

Notice how at no point do we have to worry about query keys or query functions because the
abstraction layer handles that for us - all we have to do to work with the abstraction
properly is to call the right method with the right request, give it the necessary params
and options (TypeScript will help us with that), and we're good to go! This is the kind of
developer experience I've always wanted to have.

# Wrapping it all up

As I started building bigger and bigger apps with more complex server state logic using
Tanstack Query, I started to realize that even though the hooks are great, they're not
necessarily the most intuitive and scalable way of doing things. In order for your server
state logic to be scalable, you have to create a custom hook for every query and mutation,
give every query a query key and a query function, and then you have to manage all of that
yourself. This is where the idea of "tRPC Query" was born.

I'm really excited about this abstraction layer because its API takes all the great stuff
from Tanstack Query and elevates it to new heights - more consistent, more scalable, and
hopefully also more intuitive to use. It allows you to create many different API services
that host a virtually unlimited number of API requests - and as long as each service uses a
unique name, you can be sure that there won't be any naming conflicts. It abstracts away the
boring parts of Tanstack Query and lets you focus on the important stuff, all while preserving
the great developer experience and the flexibility of the underlying library.

I don't know what I would've otherwise created without stumbling upon the documentation page
of tRPC. When you come across a great idea that you can build upon, I suggest you start from
the end result and work your way back to the foundation. That's what I did here, it turned out
much better than I expected and I can't wait to see how it will help us scale our server state
management in the future.
