Many things are about to change once you leave university and sign that very first full-time
contract. You will have to learn some basic time and work management skills, how to
communicate with your colleagues, and many other skills. A lot of these things won't exactly
come easy to you, often because you were never taught them in school. 

The purpose of this post is to provide the soon to be full-time developers with a little bit
of guidance on what to expect and how to prepare for the new chapter in their lives.

# The first day

	Write things down. Everything. You can always delete the unnecessary later.
</Highlight>
<br />

You will be nervous, you will be excited, you will be anxiously awaiting the first steps in
your new workplace. Don't expect to get any work done on your first day - first days are
almost always allocated for onboarding, getting to know your colleagues and the company,
meeting your manager, getting your inbox, Slack and other systems set up, figuring out where
the toilet and dining area is, and so on.

Write things down. Everything. You can always delete the unnecessary later. It also helps
you relieve some of the stress when you know you don't have to hold everything in your head.
If there's an onboarding guide for newcomers on how to set up your development environment,
read it thoroughly and follow it. Best case scenario, the guide will be up to date and you
will be able to set up your environment without much trouble. Worst case scenario, the guide
doesn't even exist (yep, that also happens!), in which case you have your notes to later
create one yourself and help all the newcomers after you (wink).

Most of all, take it easy today. You will be overwhelmed with information, so make sure to
get plenty of rest when you get home. The first two days in my first full-time job were
so exhausting that I had to nap for 2 hours when I got back home. The second job was a lot
easier to handle, no naps required.

# The first 3 months

## Relax the expectations

If you're just starting out in your career and you're fresh out of university, you will
likely expect yourself to be able to perform close to the level of your colleagues. This is
a complete and utter nonsense for a multitude of reasons:

- You have no real world experience working on a project larger than your university assignments or those fancy side projects you've created.
- Communication in a team of professional developers, product managers and possibly stakeholders is quite different from what you're used to from university.
- Let's be honest - being good at something, anything, takes years of deliberate practice,
regular controlled exposure to new problems and challenges and a lot of reflection - and
you've only just started.

The most important thing to realize at this stage is that nobody expects you to be a
superstar right off the bat. You won't be given the responsibility and decision-making of a
senior developer. The first 3 months to about half a year are almost exclusively reserved
for you to learn the ropes, the codebase, the processes and so on. Approach this period with
an open mind and a willingness to learn and you will be just fine.

## Drop the ego

Closely related to the previous point. The biggest mistake you can make leaving uni is
thinking you know it all. I've been there - after mere 2 years of learning how to code,
I started an internship in a small startup as a React developer. It only took a week for me
to find out I can barely contribute. Needless to say it was a very humbling experience.

	The purpose of university is to teach you enough basics to perform the job,
	not to make you an expert.

<br />

The point is, you will be surrounded by people who have been doing this for years. When
you're a junior, speaking with a senior developer feels like they're speaking a different
language. You can barely understand half of what they're saying, yet they have this aura of
confidence and calm around them that makes you admire them.

So, drop the ego. The purpose of university is to teach you enough basics to perform the job,
not to make you an expert. Expertise is developed by continuous, deliberate exposure to increasingly difficult problems and then reflecting upon them.

## Don't sleepwalk

Maybe it's just me, but I wish someone told me not to get lost in the 9-5 routine from the
get-go, especially given my age. I was still 23 when I started my first full-time job, and while I'm not much older today, I wish the first months of full-time were more memorable.

It might be upsetting to see how everyone around you on the morning commute is stuck in the
same rat race and has the exact same goal as you - to get to work, do their job, come back
home and do whatever. It's that **'whatever'** that matters - don't let it be Netflix and chill.
It's perfectly fine to just turn off the brain after a long or challenging day, but it
shouldn't become the norm. Go out, go for a run, meet new people, learn a new skill, socialize
with your friends and family, plan a trip abroad, invite your colleagues for dinner - 
whatever will make the day more enjoyable, more exciting, more memorable. If you find
yourself spending most of your free time in front of a screen, in bed or both, it's probably
time to change something.

# Practical tips in your day to day work

Each day at work will be different, but there are a few common denominators that will impact
most of the day on the job.

## Context switching

It's almost guaranteed that you will not be working on just one thing at a time continuously.
Things come up and get in the way all the time. Try to batch related tasks together or work
on them in periodic intervals. For example, I periodically check Jira, my Gmail inbox, and
pull request reviews on Github about 4 times a day - in the morning, before lunch, after
lunch and before I leave. If something takes less than 2 minutes to do, I do it right away
so that I can forget about it afterwards. If it takes more, I schedule it in my calendar.

## Urgent fixes and on-call

This is a tricky one, you can never predict what happens. If you have to drop everything and
extinguish a fire, try to take a little step back, think about the problem and the individual
steps you need to take to fix it. Simple bullet points are enough. It's easy to get
overwhelmed and stressed out when you're in a hurry, and it never leads to quality decisions.

## Meetings, standups and syncs

As few as possible, as short as possible, as focused as possible. Leave the chit-chat for
the small talk in an open office, a coffee break, lunch, or after work. It's great if your
team allows for time to socialize, but socializing doesn't belong in meetings.

## Code reviews

Assume by default that your colleagues heartfully dislike reviewing pull requests - for one
reason or another. It's very common in many companies to have tons of PRs waiting for review
and becoming a blocker. Some companies try to solve this issue by introducing rules and
policies, but there's only so much you can do. Try to keep your PRs as small as possible, be
thorough with the PR's description, attach images to help your colleagues visualize the
outcome. If you're reviewing someone else's PR, think about how much feedback you should give.
It's generally not desirable to be too nitpicky, but it's also not desirable to be too lenient.

## Time estimations

ALWAYS (!) add a buffer to your estimations. How much of a buffer depends on the task and how
much experience you have with similar tasks, but make sure to always underpromise and
overdeliver rather than the other way around. Furthermore, projects releases in software
companies are almost always delayed, so people are used to them. That doesn't mean your team
shouldn't strive to deliver on time, but it's important to relax the expectations a little.

## Documentation

There are always two problems with documentation - it gets outdated quickly and nobody can
find it. Additionally, a third potential problem is that nobody wants to read it. Keep this
in mind when you're writing docs. Document the most critical pieces of information, and set
some time aside each month to review the docs and update them if necessary.

## Learning time and budgets

Every workplace is different, but this is mostly on you. Keeping up with the latest
technologies and trends is a must in this industry, not only to come up with better solutions
in your day to day work, but also to stay relevant in the job market. If your company doesn't
provide you with a learning budget, at least ask about their policy on learning time. Make
sure to set aside some time each week to learn a thing or two, also at home - it will pay off
in the long run and it will put you ahead.

## Communication with others

I don't have much to say here, except try to keep in mind who are you talking to and what
their background is. If you're talking to your manager or anyone else non-technical, you
can't expect them to understand how you batched 4 thunks into one, colocated form state,
and built a small wrapper around your API client. Speak in a language that the other person
will understand.

# Conclusion

I hope this post was helpful to you and alleviated some of the stress you might be feeling
about your first full-time job. It's completely normal to feel anxious and overwhelmed, but
it's also important to remember that we've all been there at first. There are many years
ahead of you to figure it all out, so take it easy and enjoy the ride. Good luck!
