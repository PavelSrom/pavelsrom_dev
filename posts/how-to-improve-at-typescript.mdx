The TypeScript language and ecosystem has experienced tremendous growth in the last few years.
It has become the de-facto standard language for frontend development, and I'm so happy about
that because it really is a stellar language. I switched to TypeScript in mid-2020 and to be
honest with you, there's no way I'm going back to JavaScript. There's simply too many benefits
to TypeScript that I can't live without anymore.

However, that hasn't always been the case. The first few months of going cold-turkey on
JavaScript and fully embracing TypeScript were quite painful. The emotional rollercoaster and
love-hate relationship with TypeScript was something I had not anticipated in the slightest.
Nevertheless, TypeScript is a skill that can - and should - be practiced and improved upon.

From my experience so far, most developers can get by with a fairly basic understanding of
TypeScript. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, typing your day to day React code
isn't that hard, after all. If you're a library maintainer or you simply want to get the most
out of the language, however, you'll need to go deeper. When you do, you'll be rewarded with
APIs that are robust and simple to use, libraries that are a joy to work with, and developer
experience that brightens your day.

I'm no expert on TypeScript and don't even aspire to be one - it's Turing complete, which means
you can do some truly insane stuff with it like typing a full [bubble sort algorithm](https://twitter.com/anuraghazru/status/1511776290487279616?t=aor9BDIhHh7Q-cQ_XpTmtA&s=19).
That said, I'd like to share the things that have had the most impact on my TypeScript skills.
Some of them are mindset shifts, others are practical tips.

Let's dive in!

# Mindset shifts

## Embrace the set theory

I learned the concept of set theory about 1,5 years ago and it has significantly improved my
understanding of TypeScript. Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with sets, which
are collections of objects. If that sounds like a mouthful, don't worry, the application of
set theory in TypeScript is much simpler than that.

Set theory in TypeScript is all about thinking of types as a list of all the possible values
that a type can hold. For example, the type `string` is a set of all the possible strings that
can exist. The type `number` is a set of all the possible numbers that can exist. And so on.
Let's look at them visualized in code:

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
type MyString = string; // 'hey', 'hello', 'world', etc. - all the possible strings
type MyNumber = number; // 1, 2, 3, etc. - all the possible numbers
type MyBoolean = boolean; // true, false - booleans can only hold two values
	`}
</Prism>
<br />

This is probably nothing new, but what if we want to narrow down the set of possible values
to create a more useful string type? For example, we might want to create a string union
of array methods starting with letter "r". Let's look at how that would be done:

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
type ArrMethods = keyof Array<any>; // gives you all methods as well as indexes
type StartingWithR = ArrMethods & \`r\${string}\`; // 'reduce' | 'reduceRight' | 'reverse'
	`}
</Prism>
<br />

Plain `ArrMethods` is a set of all the possible values that can exist on an array. By using
the `&` operator, we can narrow down the set of possible values to only those starting with
letter `'r'`. Because we only care that the keys start with "r", we can use the `string` type
to represent the rest of the string. This is a very powerful concept that can be used to
create very specific types.

By the way, have you ever wondered why we use `never` in conditional types?

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
type Strings = 'hello' | 'there' | 'world'
type MyExtract<T, U> = T extends U ? T : never

type There = MyExtract<Strings, \`t\${string}\`> // 'there'
	`}
</Prism>
<br />

The reason is that `never` is an empty set. It cannot hold anything, so when TypeScript
sees `never` in a union, it will remove it from the union. It's like going to a store
with a shopping list (the condition in your type). When an item matches your list, you
put it in your cart. If it doesn't match, you leave it on the shelf. `never` is like
an empty shelf, so TypeScript will leave it on the shelf.

## Think of generics as arguments to a function

In TypeScript, understanding generics can be made simpler by thinking of them as arguments
to a function. Much like how functions take arguments to operate on different values,
generics allow types to work with different data types. When you define a generic, you're
essentially creating a template that can be filled with various types. This flexibility
enables you to write more reusable and adaptable code.

The following example shows how similar generics are to function arguments:

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
// kind of like saying "function \`Query\` that takes \`TData\` as an argument"
type Query<TData> = {
  data: TData;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

type StringQuery = Query<string>; // { data: string; isLoading: boolean; }
type NumberQuery = Query<number>; // { data: number; isLoading: boolean; }

// function \`makeQuery\` that takes \`data\` as an argument
const makeQuery = data => ({
  data,
  isLoading: false,
});

const query1 = makeQuery('hello'); // { data: 'hello', isLoading: false }
const query2 = makeQuery(23); // { data: 23, isLoading: false }
	`}
</Prism>

## When designing APIs, begin from the end

Every time I'm designing a new API, be it a library or anything else, I never worry about
the implementation details. I never think about "Oh my god how am I going to type this?".
Instead, I start from the end and gather all necessary requirements and features first,
then sketch out possible syntaxes and APIs that would satisfy those requirements. I pay
close attention to how intuitive and natural the API feels. **Only then** do I start
thinking about how to implement it and type it properly.

There's no reason to worry about typings. If you can build it in JavaScript, you can build
it in TypeScript. The only difference is that you'll need to add some types to make it work,
and if you can't figure out how to do that, that's a great opportunity to get better at
TypeScript - it's a win-win situation.

# Practical tips

## Learn intermediate concepts

Once you grasp generics, it's time to look into things like conditional types, mapped types,
and utility types such as `ReturnType`, `Partial`, `Pick`, `Exclude` etc. Apart from all these
concepts, there are also techniques that are a bit more nuanced:

- type guards
- key remapping
- discriminated unions
- the `infer` keyword
- the `as const` keyword

Equipped with these concepts, you'll be able to write more robust code, create better APIs,
and improve the developer experience of your libraries. For example, just a few weeks ago
I had a use case where I needed to convert strings from snake case to camel case:

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
type SnakeCase = 'hello_world' | 'hey' | 'typescript_is_cool';

type Camelize<S extends string> =
  S extends \`\${infer F}_\${infer L}\${infer R}\` ? \`\${F}\${Capitalize<L>}\${Camelize<R>}\` : S;

type Result = Camelize<SnakeCase>; // 'helloWorld' | 'hey' | 'typescriptIsCool'
	`}
</Prism>
<br />

You can see how combining these concepts can lead to some pretty powerful results. All I
needed to make this work was a conditional type, the `infer` keyword, the `Capitalize` utility
type, and recursion.

## Practice, practice, practice

There's no way around it - getting better at TypeScript requires a lot of practice. While it
might help to read about the concepts and watch YouTube tutorials, the only way to truly
understand them is by building your own types and using them in your code.

Try to make your own utility types that should work the same way as the built-in ones. For
example, your own `MyPick` that should imitate the built-in `Pick`. Once you start to feel
comfortable with what you know, try to build a library that uses these concepts.

Recently I've been working on a [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) wrapper
that would receive an API schema - a definition of all the endpoints and their return types -
and generate a fully typed client based on that schema. It looks a lot like creating my own
type-safe [tRPC client](https://trpc.io/docs/client/react) - it's almost the same syntactic
sugar, but also has some extra functionality on top. Here's what it looks like (simplified
for brevity):

<Prism language="tsx">
	{`
export type QueryApi<
  TApiInstance extends Record<keyof TApiInstance, Fetcher<any, any, any>>,
  K extends keyof TApiInstance
> = {
  useQuery: <TData = FetcherData<TApiInstance, K>, TError = Error>(
    params: FetcherParams<TApiInstance, K>,
    options?: Omit<
      UseQueryOptions<TData, TError>,
      "queryKey" | "queryFn" | "meta"
    > & { meta?: FetcherMeta<TApiInstance, K> }
  ) => UseQueryResult<TData, TError>;
  useMutation: <
    TData = FetcherData<TApiInstance, K>,
    TError = Error,
    TVariables = FetcherParams<TApiInstance, K>
  >(
    options?: Omit<
      UseMutationOptions<TData, TError, TVariables>,
      "mutationKey" | "mutationFn" | "meta"
    > & { meta?: FetcherMeta<TApiInstance, K> }
  ) => UseMutationResult<TData, TError, TVariables>;
  getQueryKey: <TParams extends FetcherParams<TApiInstance, K>>(
    params: TParams | (() => DeepPartial<TParams>)
  ) => readonly unknown[];
  getQueryFn: () => TApiInstance[K];
  getQueryPair: <
    TParams extends FetcherParams<TApiInstance, K>,
    TMeta extends FetcherMeta<TApiInstance, K>
  >(
    params: TParams,
    meta: TMeta
  ) => {
    queryKey: readonly unknown[];
    queryFn: () => Promise<FetcherData<TApiInstance, K>>;
  };
};

export type QueryApiClient<
  TApiInstance extends Record<keyof TApiInstance, Fetcher<any, any, any>>
> = {
  // pick properties from \`QueryApi\` depending on the key prefix,
  // so that the developer cannot use e.g. \`useMutation\` on a query
  [K in keyof TApiInstance]: K extends \`\${QueryPrefix}\${string}\`
    ? Pick<
        QueryApi<TApiInstance, K>,
        "useQuery" | "getQueryFn" | "getQueryKey" | "getQueryPair"
      >
    : K extends \`\${MutationPrefix}\${string}\`
    ? Pick<QueryApi<TApiInstance, K>, "useMutation">
    : never;
};
	`}
</Prism>
<br />

It's okay if the code above is giving you a headache, the relative complexity is not the
point. The point is being able to create type-safe, intuitive APIs that are easy to use
and a joy to work with thanks to TypeScript's ability to take developer experience to
a completely new level.

I've reached a point where being able to create APIs like the one above suffices for my
needs. I'm obviously nowhere near advanced or even expert level, but to be honest, I don't
really care, nor do I have a need or a compelling reason to get there. Make me a Redux or
even XState maintainer and it will be a very different story.
